braviaproapi - Sony Bravia API Client
=====================================

This library provides an easy-to-use Python interface for controlling Sony Bravia televisions. It implements the
BRAVIA Professional Display API, which is present on recent consumer hardware. For more information, take a look at
`Sony's API documentation <https://pro-bravia.sony.net/develop/integrate/ip-control/>`_.

It supports the following features:

    * Control and launch applications, including text entry into form fields.
    * Configuration of display and audio options
    * Control over various system functions (sleep/wake, LED configuration, power saving, etc.)
    * Direct control of external inputs and media sources
    * Emulated remote control input via IRCC commands

This library is intended for use on newer, Android-based televisions, and has been tested on 2015 and 2016 Bravia
models running Android 7.0 (Nougat).

Take a look at the `Getting Started <gettingstarted.html>`_ page to learn how to use the library.
