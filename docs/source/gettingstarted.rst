Configuring Your Television
###########################

.. danger::
  You should **NEVER** expose your television's API to the Internet directly as this poses a significant security
  risk to your network and television. If you insist on controlling your TV from outside your home network you should
  set up separate, more secure, software that only exposes the functionality you need.

These instructions are based on a 2015 Bravia TV running Android 7.0 (Nougat). The steps may differ on newer devices.

To make your television's API accessible to this library:

  1. Open Settings
  2. Select Network > Home network > IP control
  3. Set Authentication to Normal and Pre-Shared Key
  4. Select Pre-Shared Key and specify your passcode of choice.
  5. Make note of your television's IP address. You may want to make it static to avoid connection loss.

That's it! Now you can begin controlling your television.
