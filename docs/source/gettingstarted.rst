Configuring Your Television
###########################

These instructions are based on a 2015 Bravia TV running Android 7.0 (Nougat). The steps may differ on newer devices.

**WARNING:** You should NEVER expose your television's API to the Internet directly as this poses a significant security
risk to your network and television. If you insist on controlling your TV from outside your home network you should
set up separate, more secure, software that only exposes the functionality you need.

  1. Open Settings
  2. Select Network > Home network > IP control
  3. Set Authentication to Normal and Pre-Shared Key
  4. Select Pre-Shared Key and specify your passcode of choice.
  5. The API is now accessible to this library.
